# 👋 Hi 👋

- I'm Clayton

--

- I help organize this meetup

--

- Data science & engineering stuff @ Methods Consultants
    - 😎 Depot Town, Ypsilanti
    - Lotta finance 🤑 work
    
--

- `purrr` is still the best package 🐈

--

- @claytonyochum on 🐦, @claytonjy everywhere else

# "The Loop"

???
- R4DS
- well-covered by tidyverse

---

# What about modeling _in the tidyverse_?

--

- there is/was a `modelr` package

--

- `caret` (🥕 or💍 ?)

--

- `fable` (tidy `forecast`)

--

- (plenty other attempts)

---

# `caret` 🥕

--

- Wraps hundreds of individual modeling packages with a common interface

--

- So many you gotta 🔍 on the github page to get anywhere!

--

- Does it all: resampling, pre-processing, modeling, tuning, evaluation, etc.

--

- Closest we have to `sci-kit learn`

--

- 👨
💻 Max Kuhn @topepo ("Applied Predictive Modeling")

--

- Hard to overestimate time/effort from Max here, so 🙏 *praise be to Max* 🙏

---

# Max + RStudio

--

- RStudio hired Max last fall

--

- promarily working on `tidymodels`, a new `-verse` for modeling stuff

--

- focused & tidy (tibbles, functional, etc.)

--

- monolith ➡️ microservices

---

# Tidymodels

- As of a few weeks ago, there's both a [Github Org](https://github.com/tidymodels) and a [`tidymodels` meta-repo](https://github.com/tidymodels/tidymodels/blob/master/DESCRIPTION)

--

- `tidymodels` is a meta-package like `tidyverse`

--

- `tidymodels` isn't on CRAN, most constituents are

--

- These are still _beta_-level at best; lots of things are changing!

--

- `parsnip` isn't even in `tidymodels` yet

--

- (I installed from Github _today_; see last slide for versions used here)

# What does modeling involve?

- data import/prep/exploration/cleaning: `tidyverse`

--

- (re)sampling (e.g. 10-fold CV): `rsample`

--

- pre-processing (scale, center, impute, etc.): `recipes`

--

- model fitting: `parsnip`

--

- model evaluation & selection: `yardstick` & `tidyposterior`

---

# Titanic dataset

- trying to predict if someone survived or not based on things like their age, gender, how much they paid, etc.

--

- popularized on Kaggle

---

# Import it

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(fs)  # must be github version
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

data_dir <- path_home() / ".kaggle" / "competitions" / "titanic"  # used Kaggle CLI tool

train_file <- data_dir / "train" + ".csv"

cols <- c(
  "passenger_id", "survived", "ticket_class", "name", "sex", "age", "n_siblings_spouses",
  "n_parents_children", "ticket_id", "fare", "cabin", "embarked_id"
)

train_tbl <- train_file %>%
  read_csv(
    col_names = cols,
    col_types = "iiiccdiicdcc",
    skip      = 1L
  )
```

---

# Look at it

```{r}
glimpse(train_tbl)
```

---

# A (bad) first model

```{r}
library(parsnip)
requireNamespace("ranger")

model_spec <- rand_forest("classification")

# only the numeric features
rf <- fit(
  object  = model_spec,
  formula = survived ~ n_parents_children + n_siblings_spouses + fare,
  data    =  mutate(train_tbl, survived = factor(survived, labels = c("no", "yes"))),
  engine  = "ranger"
)
```

# A (bad) first model

```{r}

```

---

# How bad?

```{r}
predictions <- tibble(
  actual    = factor(train_tbl$survived, labels = c("no", "yes")),
  predicted = predict_class(rf, train_tbl)
)

predictions
```

---

# How bad?

```{r}
library(yardstick)

metrics(predictions, actual, predicted)
```

--

```{r}
conf_mat(predictions, actual, predicted)
```

---

# How bad?

```{r}
predictions %>%
  conf_mat(actual, predicted) %>%
  summary()
```

# Let's bake a 🍰

```{r}

better!

# One 🍰 is not enough!

Training error doesn't tell us much; we need a test set! Or 10!

```{r}
library(rsample)

rset <- vfold_cv(train_tbl, v = 10, repeats = 1, strata = NULL)

rset
```

---

# Anatomy of a split

```{r}
rset$splits[[1]]
analysis(rset$splits[[1]]) # training
```

---

# Anatomy of a split

```{r}
assessment(rset$splits[[1]])  # test
```

---

# Baking all the 🍰 with all the 🐈

--

```{r}
library(purrr)

rset$recipes <- map(rset$splits, prepper, recipe = rec, retain = TRUE)

rset
```

---

# Baking all the 🍰 with all the 🐈

```{r}
library(ranger)

# parsnip breaks tidyeval in weird ways
rset$models <- map(rset$recipes, ~ranger(formula = formula(.x), juice(.x)))

rset
```

---

# Taste-testing 🍰

```{r}
predict_rf <- function(split, rec, model) {
  
  test <- bake(rec, assessment(split))
  
  tibble(
    actual    = test$survived,
    predicted = predict(model, test)$predictions
  )
}

rset <- rset %>%
  mutate(
    predictions = pmap(list(splits, recipes, models), predict_rf),
    metrics     = map(predictions, metrics, actual, predicted)
  )
```

---

# Taste-testing 🍰

```{r}
rset %>%
  select(id, metrics) %>%
  unnest(metrics)
```

---

# Taste-testing 🍰

```{r}
rset %>%
  select(id, metrics) %>%
  unnest(metrics) %>%
  summarize_at(vars(accuracy), funs(mean, sd))
```

---

# Next steps

Bake a better 🍰!

--

- better recipe (fancier feature engineering)

--

- better models (_deep learning_)

--

- _tune_ the models (`parsnip::varying()`)

--

Force-feed your 🍰 to Kaggle!

- never got to that here

# Other cool `tidymodels` stuff
